Description: 
    Fits robust sparse linear regression models under a heavy-tailed error or Outliers assumption.
    The method make use of a Student-like robust
    loss function (using an Expectation-Maximization (EM)-like algorithm) and performs penalized estimation with an L1 (Lasso) penalty. 
    Another method is the Exponential Lasso where an exponential loss is used with an MM algorithm.
    Includes functions for Cross-validation (CV) model fitting, coefficient extraction, prediction, and automatic 
    tuning of the regularization parameter via information criteria such as AIC or BIC.
