Description: 
    Fits robust sparse linear regression models under a heavy-tailed error or Outliers assumption 
    using an Expectation-Maximization (EM)-like algorithm. The method make use of a Student-like robust
    loss function and performs penalized estimation with an L1 (Lasso) penalty. 
    Includes functions for model fitting, coefficient extraction, prediction, and automatic 
    tuning of the regularization parameter via information criteria such as AIC or BIC.
